# SFJAZZ keynote address

???

Piano demo with student in room with us and instructor in San Francisco. Low-latency network. Awesome. Wish all presentations had a jazz piano component. Had I know there would be a piano in the room for my presentation, I would have written a song as part of my talk.

SFJAZZ presenter mentions a power cord and it took me a few seconds to realize he wasn't talking about a power chord. #cenic2015

Anyway, it used a lot of the same technology as telemedecine, so there's that.

# Innovations Made Possible by High-speed Broadband in Public Libraries

???

Started with an inspiring vision of the Library's place in the community. Ended with a laundry list of things libraries everywhere are trying.

# MOOCs
## Using Massive Open Online Courses as Effective Outreach

???

"MOOCs are kind of old news, and boring, and going out." Proposes thinking of it as MOOOs rather than MOOCs. "Massive Open Online Outreach". 

Problems with MOOCS:
* Tend to be modeled after a "real" class
* Trends show low completion rates
* "Students" interested in MOOCs tend to already have college degrees

Outreach:
* Takes advantage of key strengths of Massive Online: video lectures, large scale discussions and peer to peer interactions
* Less focus on "completion" and more focus on "interest"
* Intended as an entry into other experiences

# CalIt2 Demos

???

* WENDI and rehab games (music glove stroke recovery, now marketed by Flint), sleep monitoring, etc.
* FABWorks

# Some guy from UCSF presented...

???

This is not a link to the talk I gave, but a link to an earlier, longer version, less entertaining of it.

# Thanks!!

???

A few other points:

* UC Irvine is a Pepsi-only campus. Bear that in mind if you are thinking about attending a conference there.
* It's weird/refreshing/disorienting to be at a conference where not one speaker has said "We're hiring."
* The music on the #cenic2015 shuttle is a lawsuit waiting to happen.
